Project: Pong

The purpose of this project was to attempt and create a pong game to the best of our abilities. Using
the knowledge I obtained from the Alien Invasion Project, I managed to create a clone of sorts with
sounds included. Most of the files were a representation of the old project files with some improvements
made to fit the scope of this project.
